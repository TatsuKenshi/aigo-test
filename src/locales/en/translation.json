  "AigoBestsellersNaslov": "Aigo Bestsellers",

Kimbap and kimchi are probably the most popular and most recognizable Korean dishes around the globe, along with bibimbap and Korean fried chicken. Take a look at what Belgrade loves the most. Who knows, maybe our menu hides your next favorite dish.",
  "TestimonialsNaslov": "Testimonials",
  "TestimonialsText": "How to choose a restaurant and how to be sure we won't regret it later? Well, the safest road goes through reviews and testimonials. Take a look at what our customers have to say about us on Google, Glovo, and Wolt.",

  "MeniGlavnaJelaNaslov": "Main Courses",

  "MeniPriloziNaslov": "Side Dishes - Banchan",
  "MeniPriloziText": "Of course, no menu, regardless of how rich it is, can't be considered complete without side dishes. Korean cuisine, as it is common in East Asia, is rich with side dishes which take a prominent place on the table.",

  "MeniDodaciText2": "For example, you might want to add another serving of soy sauce with your kimbap or treat yourself to a plate of pickled radish with your bibimbap ot tteokbokki. Also, fries go well with any meat-based dish, and another bowl of rice will improve any meal out there.",
  "MeniDesertiNaslov": "Desserts",
  "MeniDesertiText": "Of course, no menu can be considered complete without at least some dessert options. We've taken in feedback from both our returning and new customers, and we're introducing our very first selection of sweets and treats.",
  "MeniDesertiText2": "Even though they're usually considered an extra, a nice ending to a good meal, sweets can also be consumed on their own. So, if you have a sudden craving or you just feel like skipping the main course and going straight for the treat, don't hesitate to order something from our desserts menu.",
  "KontaktNaslov": "Send us an email",
  "KontaktText": "No business can expect to create a good product or offer quality services if it is neglecting feedback. Tell us what you think, what you like, and if there's something you'd like to see on the menu. Of course, we're open to all constructive criticism, as well.",
